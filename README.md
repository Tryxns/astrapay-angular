# AstrapayAngular

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.3.

## Setup Development server
This project is meant to be paired with [astrapay-spring-boot-external](https://github.com/Tryxns/astrapay-spring-boot-external) so please kindly setup the back-end local server in the first place.

To start a local development server for the front-end, run:

```bash
ng serve
```
Or 
```bash
npm start
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.
